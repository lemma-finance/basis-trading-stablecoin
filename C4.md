## Protocol Overview

Lemma is a basis trading protocol, which introduce USDL, a USD-pegged stablecoin that is decentralized, 100% capital efficient (depositing 1 USD of ETH returns ~1 USDL). Lemma uses inverse perpetual on perpetual dexes like MCDEX, Perp, etc.

Let’s say a user deposits 1 ETH on Lemma; Lemma will move that 1 ETH to a decentralized derivatives exchange and use it as collateral to short the ETH-USD inverse perpetual contract with no leverage. Assume the price of ETH is 1000 USD:
If the price of ETH increases to 1100 USD, then our short will have lost 100 USD, but our collateral will have gained 100 USD in value, meaning our portfolio’s overall value will have stayed at exactly 1000 USD. 
If the price of ETH decreases to 900 USD, then our short will have gained 100 USD, but our collateral will have lost 100 USD in value, meaning our portfolio’s overall value will have stayed at exactly 1000 USD.

In this example, when a user deposits 1 ETH at a price of 1000 USD, Lemma will create a portfolio of 1000 “synthetic USD” on their behalf. Lemma will then mint 1000 USDL to represent the user’s stake in the overall Lemma “synthetic USD” portfolio.


## Smart Contract Summary

#### USDLemma.sol

The main ERC20 token contract which represent stable coin, issued on depositing a collateral like ETH, etc. While minting and redeeming it open and close short position on respective dexed for that collateral.

#### MCDEXLemma.sol

This contract interacts with MCDEX dex to open and close short position with collateral deposited via USDL while minting USDLemma. It implements IPerpetualDexWrapper interface, used internally in Lemma to interact with different dexes in USDLemma contract.

#### xUSDL.sol

This is the staked USDL contract, where USDL are staked to earn funding rate yields from perpetual dexes. It mints a xUSDL token, representing staked + reward amount in staking contract.

## Known trade-offs in the current design

- Possible Costly xUSDL From Improper Pool Initialization
- Trust Issue of Admin Keys. We will progressively decentralized where at first it will be a multisig and then once they launch the token and it is sufficiently distributed they will give the administrative privileges to the governance contract. As for re-balancer, it is going to be an EOA at first. The team is working on a smart contract which can handle re-balancer role without depending on a specific EOA.
